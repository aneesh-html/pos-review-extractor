Shopify POS,Play Store,Russ Gardiner,3,"May 28, 2025",,"ok overall, but a little bit clunky to use. biggest complaint is the ""delete cart"" button. it's in the exact same place as the ""save"" button when you're pricing a discount. the number of times I've deleted an entire cart after a few minutes setting it up is insane. Add a delete confirmation button!!! I would also love for an option that I can turn on that will prompt to add a customer to the sale (if you haven't yet) when you go to accept payment. I get talking and forget and it screws me","Thank you for your feedback. We understand the frustration with the 'delete cart' button placement and the need for a delete confirmation.

Shopify POS,Play Store,Christina Trexler,1,"May 7, 2025",,recent update slows everything down and adds extra screens. It used to be upon checkout you could tap a credit card without having to select anything else. now you have to select 'credit card' before you can run the card. I don't know why they went backwards with this change. also the whole app is running more slowly after the last update,"Thank you for your feedback.

Shopify POS,Play Store,Tommer Kahan,3,"February 18, 2026",,"I've used it on both Android and iOS, phones and tablets, for a few months now. Shopify clearly is focused on its ecommerce product (which is great), leaving the POS quite neglected. No at store pickup scheduling, no built-in tickets, very sluggish when connected to the payments terminal (yes, fully updated), no built-in modifiers (like pizza toppings or supersizing), generally bad UI (unnecessarily huge item button). Square was better. This is not a POS, it's make believe.","Thank you for your feedback. We understand the importance of a seamless POS experience and are continuously working to improve our features.

We've been battling with the app for a few months, support tried to help but the last time they asked for all sorts of detail and screen videos, we gave up. We've had problems with search and connecting to hardware mainly. Support asked us to make sure we were on Android 12, our fairly new £175 tab isn't on it yet, and there are only a couple of high end tabs on Android 12 on the market so far as we can see. Today I bought a second hand £160 iPad 6 and downloaded the app from the Apple store and everything works! It's amazing, really fast, hooks up to our card reader instantly and search finds results right away. It's a completely different experience. I'm guessing if you are reading this you are installing on Android. My advice is don't bother, buy the most recent iPad you can justify and save yourself a load of grief. When the Android version is as good as the Apple version it will be amazing. Hopefully that will be soon and I won't have wasted money on an Android tablet.",,,35,,

Shopify POS,Play Store,Michelle Goyette,1,"October 25, 2022",,"Actually being able to take swipe, tap, or insert card payments is not possible! HORRID experience. Chipper card reader ($50+) worked great when practicing, then day of event wouldn't work! It only allowed for manual entry of credit cards, which makes the device useless & cost us time + money because people walked away! And it looks sketchy manually entering. ENTIRE day tried to troubleshoot never worked. Once back, contacted support spent and hour + and still won't work! Absolutely distraught.",,,30,,
Shopify POS,Play Store,Khristin Quigley,1,"July 20, 2021",,"Very disappointed in my POS system. Consistantly disconnecting, even mid checkout. Also completely logs me out mid checkout. The card reader disconnects and is so difficult to get it reconnected. I spend more time removing and reinstalling than I should. Frustrating as you are trying to checkout a sale. Thankful for my patient customers! This is not a POS system I would recommend.",,,15,,
