    "content": "The latest update is costing my business money!!!!!\nAs a subscriber of 2 locations per month this is not acceptable!\nWhilst it may a good idea to add the Customer Name or phone number in prior to adding shipping address, this may be ok if the items are being delivered to the customer address, this is not ok in our situation as a florist.  99.9% of our customers have their order delivered to someone other than themselves.  I had called support and they have told me that I should use a dummy customer name. The problem is at the point when we enter the dummy customer name (which is each of our store’s name) we need to wait for at least 45 sec before the system picks up the name and then prepopulates with the details.  Then we have to delete the details prepopulated and add in the correct recipient and their address.\n\nOur actual customers do not have time for us to “wait” each time and therefore, we have been forced to go back to hand writing the order on a form (going back to what we used to do prior to POS) and then go through the process of adding the sale and delivery information after we have finished with our customer.  This is all double handling and we are having to spend more money on wages!\n\nYour system is not very obliging for the amount of money we are already spending.  We are coming up to Mother’s Day where we have many orders to upload over a period of at least 2 weeks.  We cannot afford to have out staff handwriting the order and then spending more time entering the order into the system - we have gone backwards!!!\nWould love someone to contact me to discuss and have this fixed before the end of the month!!

Big thumbs DOWN from us!\nAnd in response to the comment left by Shopify, I think you guys are seriously out of touch with your customers. This basic LITE version doesn’t even have an ability to exchange?! For an instore POS system, you have to go through a crazy process of doing a refund, emailing the customer a gift card, waiting till that comes through on their phone (if they have it with them), using the gift card to credit the balance. Have you ever experienced that process yourselves in store as either a retailer or a consumer? It’s insane. \nThank you for the suggestion of contacting your support.

    "content": "I LOVED the previous Shopify pos app. \n\nIt HAD all the features we need. \n\nSince upgrading, I do not believe we should have to pay US $85/month just to be able to have the same functions and features as we had before. That’s roughly AU$125-$130 PER MONTH.   \n\nWe’re now missing the ability to: \n\n1.     Initiate a lay-by (partially paid order) \nThis is an enormous oversight and needs urgent attention. OR if the ability exists, some instruction on how to. \nURGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. \n\n2.    Search for a partially paid order using the customer name, the process which makes the most sense. We now have to scroll through the list of orders (all orders) to see which ones are partially paid, it’s impossible. \nURGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. \n\n3.    Staff pins? Trying to issue my staff a PIN number via admin as can’t work how to do it in POS app.  (they had one each before, 5 staff in total) and all I get is “Pin is already taken”. Plus I can’t see my staff listed in Shopify admin. \nAGAIN, URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. \n\n4.    The “add custom sale” tile takes you to a screen where it’s very easy to add the amount, BUT the design and layout really leads you to press the “+1” button rather than the “add to cart” button which seems quite hidden in the top right corner. \nURGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. \n\n5.    Add to cart. Paying an extra $85 (US!) per month is an extreme extra cost for a feature that was previously included as standard. The technology has not changed for this feature. \nURGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED.  \n\n6.   Remove extra steps. Please, to be exact,  a fourth option in the bottom row toolbar, that is a simple “back to checkout” option. I should not have to press 5 buttons (at minimum) to get back to the cart page. It takes valuable time and is extremely frustrating. \nURGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. \n\nSpeed and accuracy are the most important things to consider in a busy retail environment.\n\nThis upgrade has so much potential, but considering the above is clunky and does not consider the merchant in a retail environment at all. \n\nIf you’re going to upgrade and rebuild an app in complete usability and layout, then the existing services should still be available for the same subscription rate. We’re already paying for a system which now has LESS features, and your profit is going up, right? \n\nThese matters need urgent attention, as we are heading into the Christmas period and cannot afford more time and money spent for a system that worked perfectly well before the update. \n\nIt pains me to consider looking at other options than Shopify. I do not want to retrain my staff, or rebuild my store or POS system. \n\nPlease fix these issues as a matter of extreme urgency. \nIn the future when an upgrade is planned (BEFORE it is implemented) I strongly suggest deeper level merchant liaison and feedback, and restructure based on this feedback. \n\nStill a Shopify fan, just not a happy one at the moment. \nAs previously mentioned, the above mentioned matters were already standard prior to the upgrade. \n\nIsn’t Shopify as a corporation making enough money from subscriptions and Addons and percentages of online sales, without adding on the massive new POS fees just for the same features we had?\n\nPlease work these UX issues out as a matter of urgency, or my money (your profit) walks.",

    "content": "Square deactivated my account without giving me a clear reason and refuses to explain why. I originally created the account back in late 2023 but didn’t fully set it up for my business until January 2026. Shortly after creating it, March of 2024 I received an email saying my account was reviewed and permanently deactivated due to “activity that our platform is unable to support” — yet I had barely even started using it besides giving a business name and ordering a debit card and linking the banking to my bank for transfers.\n\nI called customer service and used live chat, and both representatives told me there was nothing they could do and wouldn’t tell me what triggered the deactivation. No transparency, no explanation, no real support.\n\nFor a company handling business payments, this lack of communication is unacceptable. Businesses deserve clear answers, especially when accounts are shut down. I can’t recommend Square based on this experience.\n\nEdit:\nnow I can no longer access the account as a whole as the entire account got deactivated, I try to sign up it tells me there’s already an account associated with the email I try to sign in and it doesn’t let me.",

They made me feel as if they genuinely cared about resolving the issue in a right and timely manner. That always stuck with me and I’ve had people try to convince me to switch from Square but because of the ease of use, the reliability, all the features offered, and the excellent customer service I’ve received… I just can’t see doing business with anyone else.

Their “security measures” on new accounts are excessive, poorly communicated, and operationally destructive. They placed my account under review and held deposits while still allowing payments—meaning they let you take revenue and then prevent you from accessing it to run your business.\n\nCustomer service is the real problem:\n\t•\tLack of communication: No clear explanation, no definitive release date, and shifting timeframes.\n\t•\tConstant lock/review cycle: Every time you comply, the “clock restarts” because they claim they base the review on “the last submission.” That turns into an endless delay.\n\t•\tRepetitive document requests: They ask for the same information repeatedly, even after it’s uploaded through their official system.\n\t•\tNo real escalation: Agents claim they can’t connect you to the team reviewing the account. The best you get is “a manager will contact you in 1–2 business days,” which is useless when your funds are frozen and you have contracts to fulfill.\n\nA payment processor’s job is to allow a legitimate business to operate reliably. Square did the opposite—held funds, blocked transfers/deposits, and created chaos with inconsistent support.

Without any real warning or clear explanation, they suddenly placed my account on hold and froze my funds for 180 days. This is money from legitimate work that I already completed, and Square is essentially holding it hostage.\n\nWhat makes this worse is the complete lack of transparency and support. Every time I called, I got a different answer, no real timeline, and no one who could actually resolve the issue. I submitted all requested documents, verified my identity, and fully cooperated, yet my account remained locked with no meaningful explanation.\n\nAs a business owner, this is unacceptable. Square markets itself as being “small-business friendly,” but putting accounts on hold for six months without clear justification can seriously hurt or even destroy a small business. Bills, payroll, and vendors don’t wait 180 days.\n\nCustomer service was dismissive, robotic, and unhelpful. There was no urgency, no accountability, and no empathy for the financial impact this caused. Once they have your money, you realize how little power you actually have as a customer.\n\nI would strongly caution any business owner against relying on Square as their primary payment processor. If something goes wrong, you may find yourself locked out of your own funds with no real recourse.\n\nVery disappointing experience. I will be moving my business elsewhere and do not recommend Square to anyone who depends on reliable cash flow.",

This isn’t my first loan it’s my 4th always been early paying back to. To make a long story short I like the app but if you were to ever have a customer service issue when you call all they’ll do is “escalate” your ticket but never follow through.  I was told since my account was deactivated I can’t talk to a manager. And the most recent tech support agent I talked to said after looking at my account and what had happened that I should find another merchant service with no explanation why.  I suspect that it was from the email they sent me that I was eligible to take bitcoin which upon filling out my account was triggered for deactivation a mistake on there part",

They always seem to find a way to charge you for YOUR money. I also use the square scheduling, which means they charge me an additional $29 for that every month, nearly 2% of each sale as well as an additional fee to receive ‘instant funds’, and an additional fee if you want instant transfers. Therefore, you never receive the total amount of money that you charge for your services unless you pass the fees on to your customers. It has worked in some cases, but not so much in others. If they could find a way to minimize the fees, the app would be phenomenal. The only other down side is that whatever transactions you collect Fri , Sat, & Sun will not be deposited until sometime Monday. It is a great intro into financial literacy as well.",

So I begin setting up my account I add my menu items, organize my products, and get everything ready to run my business.\n\nBut the moment I try to process my first payment, my funds get put on hold and then my entire account is deactivated. This has happened every single time I create a new account.\n\nI’ve tried multiple times, and the exact same thing keeps happening:\nSquare approves me after verification, lets me set up my account, then immediately shuts me down as soon as I try to take a payment.\n\nI still haven’t been given a clear explanation as to why this keeps happening, and it has made it impossible for me to use Square even though I genuinely want to. I’m asking Square to actually review my situation, explain what’s causing these instant deactivations, and help resolve it instead of automatically closing my account every time I try to use it.",

I don’t understand why I wouldn’t be able to get this transaction and then I decided to verify my account so I could actually access the money because I assume that was the problem and for some reason they shut down my account without an email without any warnings without saying what I could do better Without any kind of interaction.

My guess is that they are using your money to invest, buy assets, basically using your money to make money that you will see none of the profits or gains. The customer support team is a dumpster on fire, straight garbage, useless, and unsupportive in every way. They don’t care to listen, reason, interested, or curious. They tell you what you can read and find out for yourself, they treat everyone that same, like a number, they don’t treat you as a person that is making moves and taking risks. My experience with square has been nothing of ease or convenience, only full of stress, frustration, and anguish. Heed my warning., don’t use square at all. I don’t usually write reviews, but my experience forced me to write one to warn others and help others avoid the problems that square has made for me. Good luck.",

At a recent trade show, when trying to activate tap to pay on the phone, it would just error out and say tray again later. I kept trying because I left my reader at home, and I needed it to work. Finally when I get back, I contacted square and find out it needs to be activated on the main persons phone on their account. Some thing they could have easily said in the app to make sure I didn’t waste time and possibly lose customers. Also, setting things up like printers etc is always more convoluted than necessary, and when logging back into an iPad to a register set up that hasn’t been used in a while, even if that printer and iPad combo has been used before, it needs to be set up again and it doesn’t always remember settings. I am hoping the new modes works better, but again, these are things that can be done better, especially about tap to pay. There is zero reason that they shouldn’t have a pop up or message stating what needs to happen to get it to work, especially since it seems to be a common complaint online and I am sure a lot of people are having it caused by a similar issue.",

When I attempted to withdraw my funds, the company arbitrarily suspended my account without providing any clear justification or evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nWhat is even more concerning is that Square has stated they will withhold my money for 90 to 180 days before returning it, which constitutes an unlawful retention of funds and an abuse of consumer rights. Such practices undermine financial trust and put customers in a vulnerable position.\n\nI want to state clearly that there was no breach of obligations nor any suspicious activity. This was a fully legitimate, documented commercial payment. I strongly believe that Square should be subject to regulatory review for withholding customers’ funds without a valid legal basis.",

Even when customers clearly lie about a service being performed, Square automatically sides with the customer. They don’t properly consider the business owner’s side of the story, even if the customer signed off on the work.\n\nAs a business owner, this is extremely frustrating. We put in the time, labor, and parts to get jobs done, only for Square to take money back from us without fair review. It feels like they prioritize the customer’s word over real documentation.\n\nI hope Square improves their dispute resolution process and starts protecting honest small businesses as much as they protect customers. Until then, I can’t recommend them for service-based businesses where customer dishonesty can cost you big.",

Each time I call, I am told the account review will only take 1–2 days, yet it has dragged on with no resolution. My account was flagged for review due to what Square calls “fraudulent activity,” most likely because of the volume of transactions I process—which is normal for a legitimate business. In the meantime, I cannot access the money I rightfully earned. Square continues to give me the same scripted responses with no progress, leaving me unable to use my own funds. Business owners should be warned: Square can and will freeze your money for weeks at a time, jeopardizing your operations and financial stability. I am filing a formal complaint with the CFPB, and I am prepared to escalate further, including filing a police report, to recover my funds. Please do not make the mistake of trusting Square as your business banking solution.",

I read into it and if any information is missing in the review or if they don’t like it for whatever reason they can put a 90 day hold and if you fight it they can hold funds indefinitely. Beware guys! I refunded my client their money and am getting a new card processing app. Talked to customer service and there is nothing they can do. Do your research before, I didn’t know they could hold funds for 90 days and indefinitely! I just wanted an easy processor and holding funds for so long isn’t fair for small businesses like me, we need to eat and pay bills too!",

Payment transactions freeze and I was given zero guidance on hardware capabilities. I would love to add the receipt printer and barcode scanner, but no one can tell me if they are compatible. The tiles are very confusing, too. Some are grayed out and won't let me use them. I hope the developers are taking all the feedback and making adjustments.",

We've been battling with the app for a few months, support tried to help but the last time they asked for all sorts of detail and screen videos, we gave up. We've had problems with search and connecting to hardware mainly. Support asked us to make sure we were on Android 12, our fairly new £175 tab isn't on it yet, and there are only a couple of high end tabs on Android 12 on the market so far as we can see. Today I bought a second hand £160 iPad 6 and downloaded the app from the Apple store and everything works! It's amazing, really fast, hooks up to our card reader instantly and search finds results right away. It's a completely different experience. I'm guessing if you are reading this you are installing on Android. My advice is don't bother, buy the most recent iPad you can justify and save yourself a load of grief. When the Android version is as good as the Apple version it will be amazing. Hopefully that will be soon and I won't have wasted money on an Android tablet.",
