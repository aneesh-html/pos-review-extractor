As a subscriber of 2 locations per month this is not acceptable!
Whilst it may a good idea to add the Customer Name or phone number in prior to adding shipping address, this may be ok if the items are being delivered to the customer address, this is not ok in our situation as a florist.  99.9% of our customers have their order delivered to someone other than themselves.  I had called support and they have told me that I should use a dummy customer name. The problem is at the point when we enter the dummy customer name (which is each of our store’s name) we need to wait for at least 45 sec before the system picks up the name and then prepopulates with the details.  Then we have to delete the details prepopulated and add in the correct recipient and their address.

Our actual customers do not have time for us to “wait” each time and therefore, we have been forced to go back to hand writing the order on a form (going back to what we used to do prior to POS) and then go through the process of adding the sale and delivery information after we have finished with our customer.  This is all double handling and we are having to spend more money on wages!

Your system is not very obliging for the amount of money we are already spending.  We are coming up to Mother’s Day where we have many orders to upload over a period of at least 2 weeks.  We cannot afford to have out staff handwriting the order and then spending more time entering the order into the system - we have gone backwards!!!

Shopify POS,App Store,Bear1986,1,2020-12-03T15:13:51-07:00,Extortion,"I used to love shopify. Over time I’ve realised I’ve invested so much time in to this system that I’ve made myself vulnerable to their ad-hoc changes and price hikes. You cannot trust that the features you have today will be there tomorrow. Or, if the features you need will be moved beyond a paywall that is more than 100% higher than your current costs. Basically, you can’t trust them to have your back. 

Don’t get this point of sale program if you’re a new business, small business, or start-up. Don’t get this system ESPECIALLY if you’re a single store brick-and-mortar. The basic features you need are not there (being able to save a cart or make an exchange). The basic features are behind the much more expensive tier of pricing. 

Shopify leave out key functions and then advise you to purchase (subscribe) to third party apps to bring those functions in. So, the actual cost of a working system is FAR HIGHER THAN YOU THINK.

Unless we fork put a small fortune each month x several locations, all the features we had previously have now been removed. We already pay a lot of money to shopify and now on top of that they want USD $90 per month, per location, to access the features we’ve already had for years? So unimpressed. Now is not the time to be doing something like this to merchants that were relying on the POS to keep our businesses running! The layout is also awful. Big thumbs DOWN from us!
And in response to the comment left by Shopify, I think you guys are seriously out of touch with your customers. This basic LITE version doesn’t even have an ability to exchange?! For an instore POS system, you have to go through a crazy process of doing a refund, emailing the customer a gift card, waiting till that comes through on their phone (if they have it with them), using the gift card to credit the balance. Have you ever experienced that process yourselves in store as either a retailer or a consumer? It’s insane.

Shopify POS,App Store,Sarah atkins,1,2020-11-06T02:01:34-07:00,New POS upgrade needs work URGENTLY,"I LOVED the previous Shopify pos app. 

It HAD all the features we need. 

Since upgrading, I do not believe we should have to pay US $85/month just to be able to have the same functions and features as we had before. That’s roughly AU$125-$130 PER MONTH.   

We’re now missing the ability to: 

1.     Initiate a lay-by (partially paid order) 
This is an enormous oversight and needs urgent attention. OR if the ability exists, some instruction on how to. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

2.    Search for a partially paid order using the customer name, the process which makes the most sense. We now have to scroll through the list of orders (all orders) to see which ones are partially paid, it’s impossible. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

3.    Staff pins? Trying to issue my staff a PIN number via admin as can’t work how to do it in POS app.  (they had one each before, 5 staff in total) and all I get is “Pin is already taken”. Plus I can’t see my staff listed in Shopify admin. 
AGAIN, URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

4.    The “add custom sale” tile takes you to a screen where it’s very easy to add the amount, BUT the design and layout really leads you to press the “+1” button rather than the “add to cart” button which seems quite hidden in the top right corner. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

5.    Add to cart. Paying an extra $85 (US!) per month is an extreme extra cost for a feature that was previously included as standard. The technology has not changed for this feature. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED.  

6.   Remove extra steps. Please, to be exact,  a fourth option in the bottom row toolbar, that is a simple “back to checkout” option. I should not have to press 5 buttons (at minimum) to get back to the cart page. It takes valuable time and is extremely frustrating. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

Speed and accuracy are the most important things to consider in a busy retail environment.

This upgrade has so much potential, but considering the above is clunky and does not consider the merchant in a retail environment at all. 

If you’re going to upgrade and rebuild an app in complete usability and layout, then the existing services should still be available for the same subscription rate. We’re already paying for a system which now has LESS features, and your profit is going up, right? 

These matters need urgent attention, as we are heading into the Christmas period and cannot afford more time and money spent for a system that worked perfectly well before the update. 

It pains me to consider looking at other options than Shopify. I do not want to retrain my staff, or rebuild my store or POS system. 

Please fix these issues as a matter of extreme urgency. 
In the future when an upgrade is planned (BEFORE it is implemented) I strongly suggest deeper level merchant liaison and feedback, and restructure based on this feedback. 

Still a Shopify fan, just not a happy one at the moment. 
As previously mentioned, the above mentioned matters were already standard prior to the upgrade. 

Isn’t Shopify as a corporation making enough money from subscriptions and Addons and percentages of online sales, without adding on the massive new POS fees just for the same features we had?

Please work these UX issues out as a matter of urgency, or my money (your profit) walks.",,6.25.1,,,
