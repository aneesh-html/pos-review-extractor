They don’t do that anymore. Now they’re jacking up prices wanting and at times requiring you to get their plans that offer a ton of features that very small businesses and gig workers cannot use. Do not need but they still have to pay for.. now they used to offer somewhat of a à la carte type thing where you can mix and match stuff, but that stuff was even more expensive. Basically square is now for the medium to large businesses and it’s not small mom and pop in gig business friendly at all",,6.94,,,

Square POS,App Store,XxMoNsTrScOpXx,1,2026-02-15T08:43:45-07:00,"Zero Transparency, Zero Support","Square deactivated my account without giving me a clear reason and refuses to explain why. I originally created the account back in late 2023 but didn’t fully set it up for my business until January 2026. Shortly after creating it, March of 2024 I received an email saying my account was reviewed and permanently deactivated due to “activity that our platform is unable to support” — yet I had barely even started using it besides giving a business name and ordering a debit card and linking the banking to my bank for transfers.

I called customer service and used live chat, and both representatives told me there was nothing they could do and wouldn’t tell me what triggered the deactivation. No transparency, no explanation, no real support.

For a company handling business payments, this lack of communication is unacceptable. Businesses deserve clear answers, especially when accounts are shut down. I can’t recommend Square based on this experience.

Edit:
now I can no longer access the account as a whole as the entire account got deactivated, I try to sign up it tells me there’s already an account associated with the email I try to sign in and it doesn’t let me.",,6.92.3,,,

Many direct sellers operate as sole proprietors, which is the simplest form of business structure. This means they don't need to obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) unless they choose to, such as when they hire employees or want to create a more formal business entity. 

I want to use Square and have the option to utilize my Social Security Number, but it's not compliant with direct selling policies to allow me to do so.

Square POS,App Store,MaxCon Software,1,2026-01-18T18:02:38-07:00,Rating: 1/5 (would be 0 if possible),"Square has been one of the worst experiences I’ve had with a payment processor. Their “security measures” on new accounts are excessive, poorly communicated, and operationally destructive. They placed my account under review and held deposits while still allowing payments—meaning they let you take revenue and then prevent you from accessing it to run your business.

Customer service is the real problem:
	•	Lack of communication: No clear explanation, no definitive release date, and shifting timeframes.
	•	Constant lock/review cycle: Every time you comply, the “clock restarts” because they claim they base the review on “the last submission.” That turns into an endless delay.
	•	Repetitive document requests: They ask for the same information repeatedly, even after it’s uploaded through their official system.
	•	No real escalation: Agents claim they can’t connect you to the team reviewing the account. The best you get is “a manager will contact you in 1–2 business days,” which is useless when your funds are frozen and you have contracts to fulfill.

A payment processor’s job is to allow a legitimate business to operate reliably. Square did the opposite—held funds, blocked transfers/deposits, and created chaos with inconsistent support. If you need stability, predictable deposits, and actual account management, look elsewhere.",,6.90,,,

Square POS,App Store,\o/ swim,1,2025-12-22T16:52:23-07:00,GARBAGE,"I had an extremely frustrating and damaging experience with Square. Without any real warning or clear explanation, they suddenly placed my account on hold and froze my funds for 180 days. This is money from legitimate work that I already completed, and Square is essentially holding it hostage.

What makes this worse is the complete lack of transparency and support. Every time I called, I got a different answer, no real timeline, and no one who could actually resolve the issue. I submitted all requested documents, verified my identity, and fully cooperated, yet my account remained locked with no meaningful explanation.

As a business owner, this is unacceptable. Square markets itself as being “small-business friendly,” but putting accounts on hold for six months without clear justification can seriously hurt or even destroy a small business. Bills, payroll, and vendors don’t wait 180 days.

Customer service was dismissive, robotic, and unhelpful. There was no urgency, no accountability, and no empathy for the financial impact this caused. Once they have your money, you realize how little power you actually have as a customer.

I would strongly caution any business owner against relying on Square as their primary payment processor. If something goes wrong, you may find yourself locked out of your own funds with no real recourse.

Very disappointing experience. I will be moving my business elsewhere and do not recommend Square to anyone who depends on reliable cash flow.",,6.86.2,,,

This isn’t my first loan it’s my 4th always been early paying back to. To make a long story short I like the app but if you were to ever have a customer service issue when you call all they’ll do is “escalate” your ticket but never follow through.  I was told since my account was deactivated I can’t talk to a manager. And the most recent tech support agent I talked to said after looking at my account and what had happened that I should find another merchant service with no explanation why.

I noticed all the other local vendors were using the card, the square app. Three years ago, all my transactions that were swiped on the square app were immediately returned to the clients. Before I knew it all my money was gone over $30,000 just taken from my bank account without any recourse or any way to stop. It. I switched all transactions on the square to chip and manual inputs. A client 50 days after me servicing his home disputed the charge. Square gave the money back. I disputed the charge with square I sent receipts. I sent pictures. They ruled in favor of the client. Square does not help the individual entrepreneur it’s designed to screw the individual entrepreneur. I will never use this again. It’s the worst app ever don’t use it..!!!",,6.82.3,,,

Square POS,App Store,KaM-,1,2025-11-24T19:38:16-07:00,Use Venmo or CashApp instead,"Their technical platform is bereft of what passes for acceptable functionality.

I logged in to realize that a bank I have not associated with in 15 years was attached for my business, so I made steps to update the banking information to my correct account, while also disabling the “automatic transfers” that I had never turned on in the first place. 

What their system decided to do was send the entirety of the funds to the incorrect bank immediately; when I engaged their technical support for assistance, I was cited “company policy” instead of seeing an ACH process interruption (which is a standardized banking process intended for scenarios where funds are going to an incorrect account/location), and repeatedly had to retype the information already provided in the Chat transcript (which their support representatives could not be bothered to review).

I’m now out my first business payment from a client, as the funds are going to my now-divorced spouse, and I would tell anyone who operates a business that accepts credit cards to simply use Venmo or CashApp for your payment collection options, because this same issue was resolved in moments without having to be quoted “company policy” on why they would lazily not do the correct action.

I also was never given a process on removing old bank information, as there appeared no options to do so - again, both Venmo & CashApp make these actions easy to achieve.",,6.82.3,,,

They always seem to find a way to charge you for YOUR money. I also use the square scheduling, which means they charge me an additional $29 for that every month, nearly 2% of each sale as well as an additional fee to receive ‘instant funds’, and an additional fee if you want instant transfers. Therefore, you never receive the total amount of money that you charge for your services unless you pass the fees on to your customers. It has worked in some cases, but not so much in others. If they could find a way to minimize the fees, the app would be phenomenal. The only other down side is that whatever transactions you collect Fri , Sat, & Sun will not be deposited until sometime Monday. It is a great intro into financial literacy as well.",,6.82.3,,,

One is that you share the booking link to your client used to come up as a professional looking site on their message screen, with a profile picture and everything now comes up just saying booking flow, no picture, super unprofessional. The reason they are doing this is cause they are trying to force you to create a Square website. Unfortunately those square websites look like trash. So, either you look unprofessional when you're sharing the booking link currently or you look unprofessional when you share your hideous Square website. 

The other super annoying thing right now is that every time you open the app to look at your calendar, There is a pop-up happening that is forcing you to complete your set up.

And now they’re pushing even further by forcing businesses into their subscriptions just to get a somewhat reasonable rate.

I’ve been using Square for years, and I’ve watched them become increasingly greedy and less supportive of small business owners.

After I verify my identity with my government ID and complete the facial scan, Square tells me my account is approved to start taking payments. So I begin setting up my account I add my menu items, organize my products, and get everything ready to run my business.

But the moment I try to process my first payment, my funds get put on hold and then my entire account is deactivated. This has happened every single time I create a new account.

I’ve tried multiple times, and the exact same thing keeps happening:
Square approves me after verification, lets me set up my account, then immediately shuts me down as soon as I try to take a payment.

I still haven’t been given a clear explanation as to why this keeps happening, and it has made it impossible for me to use Square even though I genuinely want to. I’m asking Square to actually review my situation, explain what’s causing these instant deactivations, and help resolve it instead of automatically closing my account every time I try to use it.",,6.82.1,,,

I don’t understand why I wouldn’t be able to get this transaction and then I decided to verify my account so I could actually access the money because I assume that was the problem and for some reason they shut down my account without an email without any warnings without saying what I could do better Without any kind of interaction. I emailed support like three days ago and they still haven’t gotten back to me would not recommend.,,6.81,,,

Square POS,App Store,pelon-pelon-rico,1,2025-10-14T05:41:04-07:00,Don’t trust Square with your money.,"Square doesn’t have your best interest in mind. They don’t care about what you do, who you are, or your goals you’re trying to achieve. They can and will decide to hold your money if and when they want to. Even if you comply with their request to verify validation for it, they will hold it for 90-120 days for no reason. My guess is that they are using your money to invest, buy assets, basically using your money to make money that you will see none of the profits or gains. The customer support team is a dumpster on fire, straight garbage, useless, and unsupportive in every way. They don’t care to listen, reason, interested, or curious. They tell you what you can read and find out for yourself, they treat everyone that same, like a number, they don’t treat you as a person that is making moves and taking risks. My experience with square has been nothing of ease or convenience, only full of stress, frustration, and anguish. Heed my warning., don’t use square at all.

But there are some really frustrating things that to meare just unacceptable. At a recent trade show, when trying to activate tap to pay on the phone, it would just error out and say tray again later. I kept trying because I left my reader at home, and I needed it to work. Finally when I get back, I contacted square and find out it needs to be activated on the main persons phone on their account. Some thing they could have easily said in the app to make sure I didn’t waste time and possibly lose customers. Also, setting things up like printers etc is always more convoluted than necessary, and when logging back into an iPad to a register set up that hasn’t been used in a while, even if that printer and iPad combo has been used before, it needs to be set up again and it doesn’t always remember settings. I am hoping the new modes works better, but again, these are things that can be done better, especially about tap to pay. There is zero reason that they shouldn’t have a pop up or message stating what needs to happen to get it to work, especially since it seems to be a common complaint online and I am sure a lot of people are having it caused by a similar issue.",,6.79,,,

Square POS,App Store,Michele Coppola,1,2025-09-05T11:52:58-07:00,Warning: Square withholds customers’ money without legal justification,"I have been subjected to abusive practices by Square. I received a legitimate payment for work performed, split into two transactions of $1,000 each. When I attempted to withdraw my funds, the company arbitrarily suspended my account without providing any clear justification or evidence of wrongdoing.

What is even more concerning is that Square has stated they will withhold my money for 90 to 180 days before returning it, which constitutes an unlawful retention of funds and an abuse of consumer rights. Such practices undermine financial trust and put customers in a vulnerable position.

I want to state clearly that there was no breach of obligations nor any suspicious activity. This was a fully legitimate, documented commercial payment. I strongly believe that Square should be subject to regulatory review for withholding customers’ funds without a valid legal basis.",,6.77,,,
Square POS,App Store,Rigo B,1,2025-09-05T00:03:38-07:00,No Good for business,"I’ve been using Square to take payments, but I’ve run into a serious issue with how they handle customer disputes. Even when customers clearly lie about a service being performed, Square automatically sides with the customer. They don’t properly consider the business owner’s side of the story, even if the customer signed off on the work.

As a business owner, this is extremely frustrating. We put in the time, labor, and parts to get jobs done, only for Square to take money back from us without fair review. It feels like they prioritize the customer’s word over real documentation.

I hope Square improves their dispute resolution process and starts protecting honest small businesses as much as they protect customers. Until then, I can’t recommend them for service-based businesses where customer dishonesty can cost you big.",,6.77,,,

Square POS,App Store,All Hairr,1,2025-08-16T09:41:17-07:00,Holding Funds,"I strongly advise business owners never to rely on Square for their business banking needs. Square has been holding my funds hostage for over two weeks. Each time I call, I am told the account review will only take 1–2 days, yet it has dragged on with no resolution. My account was flagged for review due to what Square calls “fraudulent activity,” most likely because of the volume of transactions I process—which is normal for a legitimate business. In the meantime, I cannot access the money I rightfully earned. Square continues to give me the same scripted responses with no progress, leaving me unable to use my own funds. Business owners should be warned: Square can and will freeze your money for weeks at a time, jeopardizing your operations and financial stability. I am filing a formal complaint with the CFPB, and I am prepared to escalate further, including filing a police report, to recover my funds. Please do not make the mistake of trusting Square as your business banking solution.",,6.75.1,,,
