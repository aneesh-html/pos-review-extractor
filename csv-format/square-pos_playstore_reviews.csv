Square POS,Play Store,B. Simpson,1,"August 25, 2024",,"I've been using this app for years and never had an issue UNTIL NOW!! I have items that need added to my site, but the app updated on 8/16/24 and it hasn't worked right since! It won't upload a single picture no matter which way I try to do it, no matter where the file is located or what type of file or what size the file is. It won't load them! I can do the description, price, etc. but NO PICTURES. People won't buy if there's no pictures!!",,,147,,
Square POS,Play Store,William,1,"February 20, 2026",,"Processed a $4,500 payment and after Square took their fee, they froze the funds and requested ID verification. I immediately submitted everything, yet they said it will take 3 business days to review. If refunded, it can take up to 7 business days to return to my client. Small businesses rely on cash flow. Freezing funds after processing a legitimate payment is unacceptable. Very disappointed.",,,11,,
Square POS,Play Store,Ryshelle,2,"February 15, 2026",,"When it works, it's wonderful. Unfortunately today (during an event where I needed it), the app broke. It first prompted me to download the latest version since the old one was ""no longer compatible."" I did, tried to sign back in, and got the same message after the update. I had to totally uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the bug - and now tap to pay on my phone is gone. That's the only reason I have the app, and the feature is now missing. It requires hardware in order to use tap now :(",,,11,,
Square POS,Play Store,Nillastrator,2,"January 5, 2026",,"I love using square for my pos system at markets, and it's very user friendly/easy to use!! I plan on using it as my main website soon (with the free subscription). I do wish there was an annual subscription cost option instead of just monthly payments. My main problem lately has been that the app keeps undoing my work (when I add an item or image it will save, but when I go back to the item later it's not there anymore). It's been frustrating and unusable since I can't edit or add any new items",,,51,,
Square POS,Play Store,Cody Buchanan,5,"February 17, 2026",,Increased my revenue by being able to accept cards square doubled my customer base not everyone can afford to pay cash but most have a credit or debit card and the small business loans through Square was easy to sign up for went straight into my account and helped with unexpected expenses they also had a great rate and very manageable to be able to pay back,,,2,,
Square POS,Play Store,Katlynn Stover,1,"February 6, 2026",,Was just on the phone over 30 minutes to get my free reader. Absolutely insane! If it's this stressful just setting up I'm worried about trying to use it daily. I had to go in circles with chat bot to even get the number for customer service & they really couldn't even tell me what the problem was. Probably have to use this service for the weekend but definitely looking for something better. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,,,9,,
Square POS,Play Store,WebNet,5,"February 15, 2026",,"I use the Square mobile app daily for work and it’s been extremely reliable.

Square POS,Play Store,Charles Taylor,1,"February 18, 2026",,"I wish I could give 0 stars. I use square for my small business, Electrica. I used their banking services and I truly regret it. For 5 weeks I had to call over and over again to just transfer my money from savings to checking. it took 5 weeks, 25 different people and endless time on hold. a review was only suppose to take 1 to 2 days. I started jan 9th and was told 2 days, and just got it transferred today Feb 18. im deactivating this acct immediately. I never had a more miserable experience",,,2,,
Square POS,Play Store,Deace ESSC,1,"January 27, 2026",,"square is the biggest joke of a company I have ever seen! there customer service is the worst ive ever dealt with in my 43 years of life. plus if you try to cash a check, they take the money out of the writers account right away and will not put it in your account for over a week, then when you call in about it, they email you back stating that you have been blocked from calling in to try and figure out where your money is, for a week! this is one of the most fraudulent companies ever!",,,8,,
Square POS,Play Store,Leonid Voinov,1,"January 20, 2026",,Looks modern and easy to use with many features. But when they suddenly hold your money all of that no longer matters. At that point you only remember that the service is unreliable and shows no respect for its users. I would strongly recommend staying away. My business is fully legal and compliant with banks and government requirements. It is safe and transparent. Square pushed online payments and once used my funds were frozen. I never had issues with checks or e-transfers.,,,9,,
Square POS,Play Store,Mark Hammerling,3,"January 17, 2026",,"Has been working well but all of a sudden won't sync to either phone, tried everything possible.

Square POS,Play Store,Chris Rodgers,5,"January 20, 2026",,"I've tried several other services and Square is by far the best I've found. More options to receive payments from customers than others. Customer friendly devices so I'm not explaining how to use it. I have had others tell me ""their"" rates were lower. And they were correct but they left out that was ""their"" take and I still had to pay the card companies fee on top of theirs. None of that slick talk with Square. Straight forward and nothing to blindside you with.",,,38,,
Square POS,Play Store,AARON LAROCCA,1,"December 20, 2025",,"I have been using this app now. For a couple years, and every year, it gets worse in the beginning. You used to do a point of sale and the money would be in your square account with in a few hours. Now every transaction they hold for days sometimes weeks to make money off your money, they now say they need to do a review on every transaction e Even if it's the same customer, their 15th transaction shady company they're way far better processing apps out there. I will no longer be using this app.",,,22,,

Square POS,Play Store,Dakota Creppel,1,"December 10, 2025",,"I highly recommend NOT using Square for any transactions. I set up a Square account for a soccer team fundraiser using sales. After the very first sale, I received a notice that my account was under review. I then received a notice that my account was deactivated with no valid reason, and nobody, including a manager, can say what caused the deactivation.

Square POS,Play Store,anthony penwell,3,"December 29, 2025",,"ok although the fees are very high if I receive a payment transaction of $2,000 they always take $66 out to me that is extremely high as other apps like Square POS apps do not charge near that square is definitely the highest in fees so it would be nice to see them lower their fees because $60 just to process a transaction is insane other than that the app works fine sometimes it takes a while for them to process the transaction",,,10,,
Square POS,Play Store,Brian Gill,4,"January 31, 2026",,Easy to do. I like being able to withhold a percentage of my income for taxes automatically. One downside is that sometimes I need to enter a card manually and I get penalized for that.,,,5,,

Square POS,Play Store,Josh Bogenreif,2,"January 15, 2026",,dear square i.t. department. you keep updating the software but there are subtle changes that slow service down and make it unceasingly more tedious for FOH stave. for example the most 2 recent updates changed the seach bar to a magnifying glass on the top right of where the tabs are and it is not user friendly to exit out of. SLOWING SERVICE DOWN.. another one most recent : the saved ticket feature: the ability to click save ticket and slide CC is now gone and you have to click new customer.,,,3,,
