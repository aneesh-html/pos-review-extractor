They don’t do that anymore. Now they’re jacking up prices wanting and at times requiring you to get their plans that offer a ton of features that very small businesses and gig workers cannot use. Do not need but they still have to pay for.. now they used to offer somewhat of a à la carte type thing where you can mix and match stuff, but that stuff was even more expensive. Basically square is now for the medium to large businesses and it’s not small mom and pop in gig business friendly at all",

I originally created the account back in late 2023 but didn’t fully set it up for my business until January 2026. Shortly after creating it, March of 2024 I received an email saying my account was reviewed and permanently deactivated due to “activity that our platform is unable to support” — yet I had barely even started using it besides giving a business name and ordering a debit card and linking the banking to my bank for transfers.\n\nI called customer service and used live chat, and both representatives told me there was nothing they could do and wouldn’t tell me what triggered the deactivation. No transparency, no explanation, no real support.\n\nFor a company handling business payments, this lack of communication is unacceptable. Businesses deserve clear answers, especially when accounts are shut down. I can’t recommend Square based on this experience.\n\nEdit:\nnow I can no longer access the account as a whole as the entire account got deactivated, I try to sign up it tells me there’s already an account associated with the email I try to sign in and it doesn’t let me.",

They made me feel as if they genuinely cared about resolving the issue in a right and timely manner. That always stuck with me and I’ve had people try to convince me to switch from Square but because of the ease of use, the reliability, all the features offered, and the excellent customer service I’ve received… I just can’t see doing business with anyone else.

The best you get is “a manager will contact you in 1–2 business days,” which is useless when your funds are frozen and you have contracts to fulfill.\n\nA payment processor’s job is to allow a legitimate business to operate reliably. Square did the opposite—held funds, blocked transfers/deposits, and created chaos with inconsistent support.

    "content": "I had an extremely frustrating and damaging experience with Square. Without any real warning or clear explanation, they suddenly placed my account on hold and froze my funds for 180 days. This is money from legitimate work that I already completed, and Square is essentially holding it hostage.\n\nWhat makes this worse is the complete lack of transparency and support. Every time I called, I got a different answer, no real timeline, and no one who could actually resolve the issue. I submitted all requested documents, verified my identity, and fully cooperated, yet my account remained locked with no meaningful explanation.\n\nAs a business owner, this is unacceptable. Square markets itself as being “small-business friendly,” but putting accounts on hold for six months without clear justification can seriously hurt or even destroy a small business. Bills, payroll, and vendors don’t wait 180 days.\n\nCustomer service was dismissive, robotic, and unhelpful. There was no urgency, no accountability, and no empathy for the financial impact this caused. Once they have your money, you realize how little power you actually have as a customer.\n\nI would strongly caution any business owner against relying on Square as their primary payment processor. If something goes wrong, you may find yourself locked out of your own funds with no real recourse.\n\nVery disappointing experience. I will be moving my business elsewhere and do not recommend Square to anyone who depends on reliable cash flow.",

This isn’t my first loan it’s my 4th always been early paying back to. To make a long story short I like the app but if you were to ever have a customer service issue when you call all they’ll do is “escalate” your ticket but never follow through.  I was told since my account was deactivated I can’t talk to a manager. And the most recent tech support agent I talked to said after looking at my account and what had happened that I should find another merchant service with no explanation why.  I suspect that it was from the email they sent me that I was eligible to take bitcoin which upon filling out my account was triggered for deactivation a mistake on there part",

They always seem to find a way to charge you for YOUR money. I also use the square scheduling, which means they charge me an additional $29 for that every month, nearly 2% of each sale as well as an additional fee to receive ‘instant funds’, and an additional fee if you want instant transfers. Therefore, you never receive the total amount of money that you charge for your services unless you pass the fees on to your customers. It has worked in some cases, but not so much in others. If they could find a way to minimize the fees, the app would be phenomenal. The only other down side is that whatever transactions you collect Fri , Sat, & Sun will not be deposited until sometime Monday. It is a great intro into financial literacy as well.",

So I begin setting up my account I add my menu items, organize my products, and get everything ready to run my business.\n\nBut the moment I try to process my first payment, my funds get put on hold and then my entire account is deactivated. This has happened every single time I create a new account.\n\nI’ve tried multiple times, and the exact same thing keeps happening:\nSquare approves me after verification, lets me set up my account, then immediately shuts me down as soon as I try to take a payment.\n\nI still haven’t been given a clear explanation as to why this keeps happening, and it has made it impossible for me to use Square even though I genuinely want to. I’m asking Square to actually review my situation, explain what’s causing these instant deactivations, and help resolve it instead of automatically closing my account every time I try to use it.",

And I loose my money.In my opinion I gave plenty of evidence of my workmanship but it was not up to square to decide only the bank. They say they challenge it. But take your money out of your account and give it back to them. That’s all they do. I’m sure the rest of them are probably Because of the laws for the credit cards, but they’re one-sided so wrong  aiding and abetting, friendly fraud stealing",

They can and will decide to hold your money if and when they want to. Even if you comply with their request to verify validation for it, they will hold it for 90-120 days for no reason. My guess is that they are using your money to invest, buy assets, basically using your money to make money that you will see none of the profits or gains. The customer support team is a dumpster on fire, straight garbage, useless, and unsupportive in every way. They don’t care to listen, reason, interested, or curious. They tell you what you can read and find out for yourself, they treat everyone that same, like a number, they don’t treat you as a person that is making moves and taking risks. My experience with square has been nothing of ease or convenience, only full of stress, frustration, and anguish. Heed my warning., don’t use square at all. I don’t usually write reviews, but my experience forced me to write one to warn others and help others avoid the problems that square has made for me. Good luck.",

At a recent trade show, when trying to activate tap to pay on the phone, it would just error out and say tray again later. I kept trying because I left my reader at home, and I needed it to work. Finally when I get back, I contacted square and find out it needs to be activated on the main persons phone on their account. Some thing they could have easily said in the app to make sure I didn’t waste time and possibly lose customers. Also, setting things up like printers etc is always more convoluted than necessary, and when logging back into an iPad to a register set up that hasn’t been used in a while, even if that printer and iPad combo has been used before, it needs to be set up again and it doesn’t always remember settings. I am hoping the new modes works better, but again, these are things that can be done better, especially about tap to pay. There is zero reason that they shouldn’t have a pop up or message stating what needs to happen to get it to work, especially since it seems to be a common complaint online and I am sure a lot of people are having it caused by a similar issue.",

This complicates not only the receipt of funds but also damages business reputation with clients. My experience shows that even after providing all documents for my identification and proof of funds movement through bank accounts, there is no guarantee of proper account functionality with this service. On top of having to somehow return part of the payment I received for completed work, I also have to explain to my client why this happened. Extremely negative impression of this service!",

When I attempted to withdraw my funds, the company arbitrarily suspended my account without providing any clear justification or evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nWhat is even more concerning is that Square has stated they will withhold my money for 90 to 180 days before returning it, which constitutes an unlawful retention of funds and an abuse of consumer rights. Such practices undermine financial trust and put customers in a vulnerable position.\n\nI want to state clearly that there was no breach of obligations nor any suspicious activity. This was a fully legitimate, documented commercial payment. I strongly believe that Square should be subject to regulatory review for withholding customers’ funds without a valid legal basis.",

We put in the time, labor, and parts to get jobs done, only for Square to take money back from us without fair review. It feels like they prioritize the customer’s word over real documentation.\n\nI hope Square improves their dispute resolution process and starts protecting honest small businesses as much as they protect customers. Until then, I can’t recommend them for service-based businesses where customer dishonesty can cost you big.",

Each time I call, I am told the account review will only take 1–2 days, yet it has dragged on with no resolution. My account was flagged for review due to what Square calls “fraudulent activity,” most likely because of the volume of transactions I process—which is normal for a legitimate business. In the meantime, I cannot access the money I rightfully earned. Square continues to give me the same scripted responses with no progress, leaving me unable to use my own funds. Business owners should be warned: Square can and will freeze your money for weeks at a time, jeopardizing your operations and financial stability. I am filing a formal complaint with the CFPB, and I am prepared to escalate further, including filing a police report, to recover my funds. Please do not make the mistake of trusting Square as your business banking solution.",

    "content": "Started my new business recently, clients usually pay me via Zelle. I used square for the clients that wanted to pay me via card for my services and sales. I had gotten a new client that had a high budget and when using square 3 days in a row they ended up putting a hold on my funds which was $2000. I read into it and if any information is missing in the review or if they don’t like it for whatever reason they can put a 90 day hold and if you fight it they can hold funds indefinitely. Beware guys! I refunded my client their money and am getting a new card processing app. Talked to customer service and there is nothing they can do. Do your research before, I didn’t know they could hold funds for 90 days and indefinitely! I just wanted an easy processor and holding funds for so long isn’t fair for small businesses like me, we need to eat and pay bills too!",
