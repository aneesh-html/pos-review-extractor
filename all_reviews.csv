As a subscriber of 2 locations per month this is not acceptable!
Whilst it may a good idea to add the Customer Name or phone number in prior to adding shipping address, this may be ok if the items are being delivered to the customer address, this is not ok in our situation as a florist.  99.9% of our customers have their order delivered to someone other than themselves.  I had called support and they have told me that I should use a dummy customer name. The problem is at the point when we enter the dummy customer name (which is each of our store’s name) we need to wait for at least 45 sec before the system picks up the name and then prepopulates with the details.  Then we have to delete the details prepopulated and add in the correct recipient and their address.

Our actual customers do not have time for us to “wait” each time and therefore, we have been forced to go back to hand writing the order on a form (going back to what we used to do prior to POS) and then go through the process of adding the sale and delivery information after we have finished with our customer.  This is all double handling and we are having to spend more money on wages!

Your system is not very obliging for the amount of money we are already spending.  We are coming up to Mother’s Day where we have many orders to upload over a period of at least 2 weeks.  We cannot afford to have out staff handwriting the order and then spending more time entering the order into the system - we have gone backwards!!!

Shopify POS,App Store,Bear1986,1,2020-12-03T15:13:51-07:00,Extortion,"I used to love shopify. Over time I’ve realised I’ve invested so much time in to this system that I’ve made myself vulnerable to their ad-hoc changes and price hikes. You cannot trust that the features you have today will be there tomorrow. Or, if the features you need will be moved beyond a paywall that is more than 100% higher than your current costs. Basically, you can’t trust them to have your back. 

Don’t get this point of sale program if you’re a new business, small business, or start-up. Don’t get this system ESPECIALLY if you’re a single store brick-and-mortar. The basic features you need are not there (being able to save a cart or make an exchange). The basic features are behind the much more expensive tier of pricing. 

Shopify leave out key functions and then advise you to purchase (subscribe) to third party apps to bring those functions in. So, the actual cost of a working system is FAR HIGHER THAN YOU THINK.

Unless we fork put a small fortune each month x several locations, all the features we had previously have now been removed. We already pay a lot of money to shopify and now on top of that they want USD $90 per month, per location, to access the features we’ve already had for years? So unimpressed. Now is not the time to be doing something like this to merchants that were relying on the POS to keep our businesses running! The layout is also awful. Big thumbs DOWN from us!
And in response to the comment left by Shopify, I think you guys are seriously out of touch with your customers. This basic LITE version doesn’t even have an ability to exchange?! For an instore POS system, you have to go through a crazy process of doing a refund, emailing the customer a gift card, waiting till that comes through on their phone (if they have it with them), using the gift card to credit the balance. Have you ever experienced that process yourselves in store as either a retailer or a consumer? It’s insane.

Shopify POS,App Store,Sarah atkins,1,2020-11-06T02:01:34-07:00,New POS upgrade needs work URGENTLY,"I LOVED the previous Shopify pos app. 

It HAD all the features we need. 

Since upgrading, I do not believe we should have to pay US $85/month just to be able to have the same functions and features as we had before. That’s roughly AU$125-$130 PER MONTH.   

We’re now missing the ability to: 

1.     Initiate a lay-by (partially paid order) 
This is an enormous oversight and needs urgent attention. OR if the ability exists, some instruction on how to. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

2.    Search for a partially paid order using the customer name, the process which makes the most sense. We now have to scroll through the list of orders (all orders) to see which ones are partially paid, it’s impossible. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

3.    Staff pins? Trying to issue my staff a PIN number via admin as can’t work how to do it in POS app.  (they had one each before, 5 staff in total) and all I get is “Pin is already taken”. Plus I can’t see my staff listed in Shopify admin. 
AGAIN, URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

4.    The “add custom sale” tile takes you to a screen where it’s very easy to add the amount, BUT the design and layout really leads you to press the “+1” button rather than the “add to cart” button which seems quite hidden in the top right corner. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

5.    Add to cart. Paying an extra $85 (US!) per month is an extreme extra cost for a feature that was previously included as standard. The technology has not changed for this feature. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED.  

6.   Remove extra steps. Please, to be exact,  a fourth option in the bottom row toolbar, that is a simple “back to checkout” option. I should not have to press 5 buttons (at minimum) to get back to the cart page. It takes valuable time and is extremely frustrating. 
URGENT ATTENTION REQUIRED. 

Speed and accuracy are the most important things to consider in a busy retail environment.

This upgrade has so much potential, but considering the above is clunky and does not consider the merchant in a retail environment at all. 

If you’re going to upgrade and rebuild an app in complete usability and layout, then the existing services should still be available for the same subscription rate. We’re already paying for a system which now has LESS features, and your profit is going up, right? 

These matters need urgent attention, as we are heading into the Christmas period and cannot afford more time and money spent for a system that worked perfectly well before the update. 

It pains me to consider looking at other options than Shopify. I do not want to retrain my staff, or rebuild my store or POS system. 

Please fix these issues as a matter of extreme urgency. 
In the future when an upgrade is planned (BEFORE it is implemented) I strongly suggest deeper level merchant liaison and feedback, and restructure based on this feedback. 

Still a Shopify fan, just not a happy one at the moment. 
As previously mentioned, the above mentioned matters were already standard prior to the upgrade. 

Isn’t Shopify as a corporation making enough money from subscriptions and Addons and percentages of online sales, without adding on the massive new POS fees just for the same features we had?

Please work these UX issues out as a matter of urgency, or my money (your profit) walks.",,6.25.1,,,

They don’t do that anymore. Now they’re jacking up prices wanting and at times requiring you to get their plans that offer a ton of features that very small businesses and gig workers cannot use. Do not need but they still have to pay for.. now they used to offer somewhat of a à la carte type thing where you can mix and match stuff, but that stuff was even more expensive.

Square POS,App Store,XxMoNsTrScOpXx,1,2026-02-15T08:43:45-07:00,"Zero Transparency, Zero Support","Square deactivated my account without giving me a clear reason and refuses to explain why. I originally created the account back in late 2023 but didn’t fully set it up for my business until January 2026. Shortly after creating it, March of 2024 I received an email saying my account was reviewed and permanently deactivated due to “activity that our platform is unable to support” — yet I had barely even started using it besides giving a business name and ordering a debit card and linking the banking to my bank for transfers.

I called customer service and used live chat, and both representatives told me there was nothing they could do and wouldn’t tell me what triggered the deactivation. No transparency, no explanation, no real support.

For a company handling business payments, this lack of communication is unacceptable. Businesses deserve clear answers, especially when accounts are shut down. I can’t recommend Square based on this experience.

Edit:
now I can no longer access the account as a whole as the entire account got deactivated, I try to sign up it tells me there’s already an account associated with the email I try to sign in and it doesn’t let me.",,6.92.3,,,

Square POS,App Store,MaxCon Software,1,2026-01-18T18:02:38-07:00,Rating: 1/5 (would be 0 if possible),"Square has been one of the worst experiences I’ve had with a payment processor. Their “security measures” on new accounts are excessive, poorly communicated, and operationally destructive. They placed my account under review and held deposits while still allowing payments—meaning they let you take revenue and then prevent you from accessing it to run your business.

Customer service is the real problem:
	•	Lack of communication: No clear explanation, no definitive release date, and shifting timeframes.
	•	Constant lock/review cycle: Every time you comply, the “clock restarts” because they claim they base the review on “the last submission.” That turns into an endless delay.
	•	Repetitive document requests: They ask for the same information repeatedly, even after it’s uploaded through their official system.
	•	No real escalation: Agents claim they can’t connect you to the team reviewing the account. The best you get is “a manager will contact you in 1–2 business days,” which is useless when your funds are frozen and you have contracts to fulfill.

A payment processor’s job is to allow a legitimate business to operate reliably. Square did the opposite—held funds, blocked transfers/deposits, and created chaos with inconsistent support. If you need stability, predictable deposits, and actual account management, look elsewhere.",,6.90,,,

Square POS,App Store,\o/ swim,1,2025-12-22T16:52:23-07:00,GARBAGE,"I had an extremely frustrating and damaging experience with Square. Without any real warning or clear explanation, they suddenly placed my account on hold and froze my funds for 180 days. This is money from legitimate work that I already completed, and Square is essentially holding it hostage.

What makes this worse is the complete lack of transparency and support. Every time I called, I got a different answer, no real timeline, and no one who could actually resolve the issue. I submitted all requested documents, verified my identity, and fully cooperated, yet my account remained locked with no meaningful explanation.

As a business owner, this is unacceptable. Square markets itself as being “small-business friendly,” but putting accounts on hold for six months without clear justification can seriously hurt or even destroy a small business. Bills, payroll, and vendors don’t wait 180 days.

Customer service was dismissive, robotic, and unhelpful. There was no urgency, no accountability, and no empathy for the financial impact this caused. Once they have your money, you realize how little power you actually have as a customer.

I would strongly caution any business owner against relying on Square as their primary payment processor. If something goes wrong, you may find yourself locked out of your own funds with no real recourse.

Very disappointing experience. I will be moving my business elsewhere and do not recommend Square to anyone who depends on reliable cash flow.",,6.86.2,,,

This isn’t my first loan it’s my 4th always been early paying back to. To make a long story short I like the app but if you were to ever have a customer service issue when you call all they’ll do is “escalate” your ticket but never follow through.  I was told since my account was deactivated I can’t talk to a manager. And the most recent tech support agent I talked to said after looking at my account and what had happened that I should find another merchant service with no explanation why.

I noticed all the other local vendors were using the card, the square app. Three years ago, all my transactions that were swiped on the square app were immediately returned to the clients. Before I knew it all my money was gone over $30,000 just taken from my bank account without any recourse or any way to stop. It. I switched all transactions on the square to chip and manual inputs. A client 50 days after me servicing his home disputed the charge. Square gave the money back. I disputed the charge with square I sent receipts. I sent pictures. They ruled in favor of the client. Square does not help the individual entrepreneur it’s designed to screw the individual entrepreneur. I will never use this again. It’s the worst app ever don’t use it..!!!",,6.82.3,,,

Square POS,App Store,KaM-,1,2025-11-24T19:38:16-07:00,Use Venmo or CashApp instead,"Their technical platform is bereft of what passes for acceptable functionality.

I logged in to realize that a bank I have not associated with in 15 years was attached for my business, so I made steps to update the banking information to my correct account, while also disabling the “automatic transfers” that I had never turned on in the first place. 

What their system decided to do was send the entirety of the funds to the incorrect bank immediately; when I engaged their technical support for assistance, I was cited “company policy” instead of seeing an ACH process interruption (which is a standardized banking process intended for scenarios where funds are going to an incorrect account/location), and repeatedly had to retype the information already provided in the Chat transcript (which their support representatives could not be bothered to review).

I’m now out my first business payment from a client, as the funds are going to my now-divorced spouse, and I would tell anyone who operates a business that accepts credit cards to simply use Venmo or CashApp for your payment collection options, because this same issue was resolved in moments without having to be quoted “company policy” on why they would lazily not do the correct action.

I also was never given a process on removing old bank information, as there appeared no options to do so - again, both Venmo & CashApp make these actions easy to achieve.",,6.82.3,,,

They always seem to find a way to charge you for YOUR money. I also use the square scheduling, which means they charge me an additional $29 for that every month, nearly 2% of each sale as well as an additional fee to receive ‘instant funds’, and an additional fee if you want instant transfers. Therefore, you never receive the total amount of money that you charge for your services unless you pass the fees on to your customers. It has worked in some cases, but not so much in others. If they could find a way to minimize the fees, the app would be phenomenal. The only other down side is that whatever transactions you collect Fri , Sat, & Sun will not be deposited until sometime Monday. It is a great intro into financial literacy as well.",,6.82.3,,,

The reason they are doing this is cause they are trying to force you to create a Square website. Unfortunately those square websites look like trash. So, either you look unprofessional when you're sharing the booking link currently or you look unprofessional when you share your hideous Square website. 

The other super annoying thing right now is that every time you open the app to look at your calendar, There is a pop-up happening that is forcing you to complete your set up.

I’ve been using Square for years, and I’ve watched them become increasingly greedy and less supportive of small business owners.

After I verify my identity with my government ID and complete the facial scan, Square tells me my account is approved to start taking payments. So I begin setting up my account I add my menu items, organize my products, and get everything ready to run my business.

But the moment I try to process my first payment, my funds get put on hold and then my entire account is deactivated. This has happened every single time I create a new account.

I’ve tried multiple times, and the exact same thing keeps happening:
Square approves me after verification, lets me set up my account, then immediately shuts me down as soon as I try to take a payment.

I still haven’t been given a clear explanation as to why this keeps happening, and it has made it impossible for me to use Square even though I genuinely want to.

Square POS,App Store,pelon-pelon-rico,1,2025-10-14T05:41:04-07:00,Don’t trust Square with your money.,"Square doesn’t have your best interest in mind. They don’t care about what you do, who you are, or your goals you’re trying to achieve. They can and will decide to hold your money if and when they want to. Even if you comply with their request to verify validation for it, they will hold it for 90-120 days for no reason. My guess is that they are using your money to invest, buy assets, basically using your money to make money that you will see none of the profits or gains. The customer support team is a dumpster on fire, straight garbage, useless, and unsupportive in every way. They don’t care to listen, reason, interested, or curious. They tell you what you can read and find out for yourself, they treat everyone that same, like a number, they don’t treat you as a person that is making moves and taking risks. My experience with square has been nothing of ease or convenience, only full of stress, frustration, and anguish. Heed my warning., don’t use square at all.

But there are some really frustrating things that to meare just unacceptable. At a recent trade show, when trying to activate tap to pay on the phone, it would just error out and say tray again later. I kept trying because I left my reader at home, and I needed it to work. Finally when I get back, I contacted square and find out it needs to be activated on the main persons phone on their account. Some thing they could have easily said in the app to make sure I didn’t waste time and possibly lose customers. Also, setting things up like printers etc is always more convoluted than necessary, and when logging back into an iPad to a register set up that hasn’t been used in a while, even if that printer and iPad combo has been used before, it needs to be set up again and it doesn’t always remember settings. I am hoping the new modes works better, but again, these are things that can be done better, especially about tap to pay. There is zero reason that they shouldn’t have a pop up or message stating what needs to happen to get it to work, especially since it seems to be a common complaint online and I am sure a lot of people are having it caused by a similar issue.",,6.79,,,

Square POS,App Store,Michele Coppola,1,2025-09-05T11:52:58-07:00,Warning: Square withholds customers’ money without legal justification,"I have been subjected to abusive practices by Square. I received a legitimate payment for work performed, split into two transactions of $1,000 each. When I attempted to withdraw my funds, the company arbitrarily suspended my account without providing any clear justification or evidence of wrongdoing.

What is even more concerning is that Square has stated they will withhold my money for 90 to 180 days before returning it, which constitutes an unlawful retention of funds and an abuse of consumer rights. Such practices undermine financial trust and put customers in a vulnerable position.

I want to state clearly that there was no breach of obligations nor any suspicious activity. This was a fully legitimate, documented commercial payment. I strongly believe that Square should be subject to regulatory review for withholding customers’ funds without a valid legal basis.",,6.77,,,
Square POS,App Store,Rigo B,1,2025-09-05T00:03:38-07:00,No Good for business,"I’ve been using Square to take payments, but I’ve run into a serious issue with how they handle customer disputes. Even when customers clearly lie about a service being performed, Square automatically sides with the customer. They don’t properly consider the business owner’s side of the story, even if the customer signed off on the work.

As a business owner, this is extremely frustrating. We put in the time, labor, and parts to get jobs done, only for Square to take money back from us without fair review. It feels like they prioritize the customer’s word over real documentation.

I hope Square improves their dispute resolution process and starts protecting honest small businesses as much as they protect customers. Until then, I can’t recommend them for service-based businesses where customer dishonesty can cost you big.",,6.77,,,

Square POS,App Store,All Hairr,1,2025-08-16T09:41:17-07:00,Holding Funds,"I strongly advise business owners never to rely on Square for their business banking needs. Square has been holding my funds hostage for over two weeks. Each time I call, I am told the account review will only take 1–2 days, yet it has dragged on with no resolution. My account was flagged for review due to what Square calls “fraudulent activity,” most likely because of the volume of transactions I process—which is normal for a legitimate business. In the meantime, I cannot access the money I rightfully earned. Square continues to give me the same scripted responses with no progress, leaving me unable to use my own funds. Business owners should be warned: Square can and will freeze your money for weeks at a time, jeopardizing your operations and financial stability. I am filing a formal complaint with the CFPB, and I am prepared to escalate further, including filing a police report, to recover my funds. Please do not make the mistake of trusting Square as your business banking solution.",,6.75.1,,,

Shopify POS,Play Store,Russ Gardiner,3,"May 28, 2025",,"ok overall, but a little bit clunky to use. biggest complaint is the ""delete cart"" button. it's in the exact same place as the ""save"" button when you're pricing a discount. the number of times I've deleted an entire cart after a few minutes setting it up is insane.

Today I bought a second hand £160 iPad 6 and downloaded the app from the Apple store and everything works! It's amazing, really fast, hooks up to our card reader instantly and search finds results right away. It's a completely different experience. I'm guessing if you are reading this you are installing on Android. My advice is don't bother, buy the most recent iPad you can justify and save yourself a load of grief.

If the item won't scan for the measley few points then I'm not going to buy the item either because it's not accepting the barcode. I have not found A SINGLE item at ANY of the stores. It's a waste of time and energy.,,,9,,
Shopify POS,Play Store,Paul Tayar,1,"May 18, 2020",,"DO NOT UPGRADE. Old POS worked fine, new version looks cool and has some nice features but is missing half my inventory. Every 2nd item does not show and I have to manually write a line and then adjust the stock on another app. Not fun with a line of customers. Shopify have advised this is happening to multiple users and not just me. I can't roll back and my POS is a dead weight now. Don't upgrade to the new version until they sort this. It's totally screwed us.",,,10,,
Shopify POS,Play Store,Michelle Goyette,1,"October 25, 2022",,"Actually being able to take swipe, tap, or insert card payments is not possible! HORRID experience. Chipper card reader ($50+) worked great when practicing, then day of event wouldn't work! It only allowed for manual entry of credit cards, which makes the device useless & cost us time + money because people walked away! And it looks sketchy manually entering. ENTIRE day tried to troubleshoot never worked. Once back, contacted support spent and hour + and still won't work! Absolutely distraught.",,,30,,
Shopify POS,Play Store,Khristin Quigley,1,"July 20, 2021",,"Very disappointed in my POS system. Consistantly disconnecting, even mid checkout. Also completely logs me out mid checkout. The card reader disconnects and is so difficult to get it reconnected. I spend more time removing and reinstalling than I should. Frustrating as you are trying to checkout a sale. Thankful for my patient customers! This is not a POS system I would recommend.",,,15,,
Square POS,Play Store,B. Simpson,1,"August 25, 2024",,"I've been using this app for years and never had an issue UNTIL NOW!! I have items that need added to my site, but the app updated on 8/16/24 and it hasn't worked right since! It won't upload a single picture no matter which way I try to do it, no matter where the file is located or what type of file or what size the file is. It won't load them! I can do the description, price, etc. but NO PICTURES. People won't buy if there's no pictures!!",,,147,,
Square POS,Play Store,William,1,"February 20, 2026",,"Processed a $4,500 payment and after Square took their fee, they froze the funds and requested ID verification. I immediately submitted everything, yet they said it will take 3 business days to review. If refunded, it can take up to 7 business days to return to my client. Small businesses rely on cash flow. Freezing funds after processing a legitimate payment is unacceptable. Very disappointed.",,,11,,
Square POS,Play Store,Ryshelle,2,"February 15, 2026",,"When it works, it's wonderful. Unfortunately today (during an event where I needed it), the app broke. It first prompted me to download the latest version since the old one was ""no longer compatible."" I did, tried to sign back in, and got the same message after the update. I had to totally uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the bug - and now tap to pay on my phone is gone. That's the only reason I have the app, and the feature is now missing. It requires hardware in order to use tap now :(",,,11,,
Square POS,Play Store,Nillastrator,2,"January 5, 2026",,"I love using square for my pos system at markets, and it's very user friendly/easy to use!! I plan on using it as my main website soon (with the free subscription). I do wish there was an annual subscription cost option instead of just monthly payments. My main problem lately has been that the app keeps undoing my work (when I add an item or image it will save, but when I go back to the item later it's not there anymore). It's been frustrating and unusable since I can't edit or add any new items",,,51,,
Square POS,Play Store,Cody Buchanan,5,"February 17, 2026",,Increased my revenue by being able to accept cards square doubled my customer base not everyone can afford to pay cash but most have a credit or debit card and the small business loans through Square was easy to sign up for went straight into my account and helped with unexpected expenses they also had a great rate and very manageable to be able to pay back,,,2,,
Square POS,Play Store,Katlynn Stover,1,"February 6, 2026",,Was just on the phone over 30 minutes to get my free reader. Absolutely insane! If it's this stressful just setting up I'm worried about trying to use it daily. I had to go in circles with chat bot to even get the number for customer service & they really couldn't even tell me what the problem was. Probably have to use this service for the weekend but definitely looking for something better. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,,,9,,
Square POS,Play Store,WebNet,5,"February 15, 2026",,"I use the Square mobile app daily for work and it’s been extremely reliable.

Square POS,Play Store,Charles Taylor,1,"February 18, 2026",,"I wish I could give 0 stars. I use square for my small business, Electrica. I used their banking services and I truly regret it. For 5 weeks I had to call over and over again to just transfer my money from savings to checking. it took 5 weeks, 25 different people and endless time on hold. a review was only suppose to take 1 to 2 days. I started jan 9th and was told 2 days, and just got it transferred today Feb 18. im deactivating this acct immediately. I never had a more miserable experience",,,2,,
Square POS,Play Store,Deace ESSC,1,"January 27, 2026",,"square is the biggest joke of a company I have ever seen! there customer service is the worst ive ever dealt with in my 43 years of life. plus if you try to cash a check, they take the money out of the writers account right away and will not put it in your account for over a week, then when you call in about it, they email you back stating that you have been blocked from calling in to try and figure out where your money is, for a week! this is one of the most fraudulent companies ever!",,,8,,
Square POS,Play Store,Leonid Voinov,1,"January 20, 2026",,Looks modern and easy to use with many features. But when they suddenly hold your money all of that no longer matters. At that point you only remember that the service is unreliable and shows no respect for its users. I would strongly recommend staying away. My business is fully legal and compliant with banks and government requirements. It is safe and transparent. Square pushed online payments and once used my funds were frozen. I never had issues with checks or e-transfers.,,,9,,
Square POS,Play Store,Mark Hammerling,3,"January 17, 2026",,"Has been working well but all of a sudden won't sync to either phone, tried everything possible. There is no way to contact support to help in these situations. Not the first time it has had trouble. Might be time to find another supplier if they can't support us considering the always take their fee's",,,4,,
Square POS,Play Store,Chris Rodgers,5,"January 20, 2026",,"I've tried several other services and Square is by far the best I've found. More options to receive payments from customers than others. Customer friendly devices so I'm not explaining how to use it. I have had others tell me ""their"" rates were lower. And they were correct but they left out that was ""their"" take and I still had to pay the card companies fee on top of theirs. None of that slick talk with Square. Straight forward and nothing to blindside you with.",,,38,,
Square POS,Play Store,AARON LAROCCA,1,"December 20, 2025",,"I have been using this app now. For a couple years, and every year, it gets worse in the beginning. You used to do a point of sale and the money would be in your square account with in a few hours. Now every transaction they hold for days sometimes weeks to make money off your money, they now say they need to do a review on every transaction e Even if it's the same customer, their 15th transaction shady company they're way far better processing apps out there. I will no longer be using this app.",,,22,,

Square POS,Play Store,Mr600,1,"February 16, 2026",,"brand new problem to add to the list.....we pay a membership subscription, yet service is still as poor as before....the map for delivery does NOT update every 20secs so there's no telling where the driver may be or when they may arrive or deliver order, it's increasingly irritating we have to pay for little to NO SERVICE!!",,,,,
Square POS,Play Store,Dakota Creppel,1,"December 10, 2025",,"I highly recommend NOT using Square for any transactions. I set up a Square account for a soccer team fundraiser using sales.

I then received a notice that my account was deactivated with no valid reason, and nobody, including a manager, can say what caused the deactivation.

Square POS,Play Store,anthony penwell,3,"December 29, 2025",,"ok although the fees are very high if I receive a payment transaction of $2,000 they always take $66 out to me that is extremely high as other apps like Square POS apps do not charge near that square is definitely the highest in fees so it would be nice to see them lower their fees because $60 just to process a transaction is insane other than that the app works fine sometimes it takes a while for them to process the transaction",,,10,,
Square POS,Play Store,Brian Gill,4,"January 31, 2026",,Easy to do. I like being able to withhold a percentage of my income for taxes automatically. One downside is that sometimes I need to enter a card manually and I get penalized for that.,,,5,,

Square POS,Play Store,Josh Bogenreif,2,"January 15, 2026",,dear square i.t. department. you keep updating the software but there are subtle changes that slow service down and make it unceasingly more tedious for FOH stave. for example the most 2 recent updates changed the seach bar to a magnifying glass on the top right of where the tabs are and it is not user friendly to exit out of. SLOWING SERVICE DOWN.. another one most recent : the saved ticket feature: the ability to click save ticket and slide CC is now gone and you have to click new customer.,,,3,,
